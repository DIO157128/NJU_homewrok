|    6 | The systematic review (SR) is a methodology used to find and aggregate all relevant existing evidence about a specific research question of interest. One of the activities associated with the SR process is the selection of primary studies, which is a time consuming manual task. The quality of primary study selection impacts the overall quality of SR. The goal of this paper is to propose a strategy named "Score Citation Automatic Selection" (SCAS), to automate part of the primary study selection activity. The SCAS strategy combines two different features, content and citation relationships between the studies, to make the selection activity as automated as possible. Aiming to evaluate the feasibility of our strategy, we conducted an exploratory case study to compare the accuracy of selecting primary studies manually and using the SCAS strategy. The case study shows that for three SRs published in the literature and previously conducted in a manual implementation, the average effort reduction was 58.2 % when applying the SCAS strategy to automate part of the initial selection of primary studies, and the percentage error was 12.98 %. Our case study provided confidence in our strategy, and suggested that it can reduce the effort required to select the primary studies without adversely affecting the overall results of SR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

|    8 | Debugging is a crucial yet expensive activity to improve the reliability of software systems. To reduce debugging cost, various fault localization tools have been proposed. A spectrum-based fault localization tool often outputs an ordered list of program elements sorted based on their likelihood to be the root cause of a set of failures (i.e., their suspiciousness scores). Despite the many studies on fault localization, unfortunately, however, for many bugs, the root causes are often low in the ordered list. This potentially causes developers to distrust fault localization tools. Recently, Parnin and Orso highlight in their user study that many debuggers do not find fault localization useful if they do not find the root cause early in the list. To alleviate the above issue, we build an oracle that could predict whether the output of a fault localization tool can be trusted or not. If the output is not likely to be trusted, developers do not need to spend time going through the list of most suspicious program elements one by one. Rather, other conventional means of debugging could be performed. To construct the oracle, we extract the values of a number of features that are potentially related to the effectiveness of fault localization. Building upon advances in machine learning, we process these feature values to learn a discriminative model that is able to predict the effectiveness of a fault localization tool output. In this work, we consider an output of a fault localization tool to be effective if the root cause appears in the top 10 most suspicious program elements. We have evaluated our proposed oracle on 200 faulty versions of Space, NanoXML, XML-Security, and the 7 programs in Siemens test suite. Our experiments demonstrate that we could predict the effectiveness of 9 fault localization tools with a precision, recall, and F-measure (harmonic mean of precision and recall) of up to 74.38 %, 90.00 % and 81.45 %, respectively. The numbers indicate that many ineffective fault localization instances are identified correctly, while only few effective ones are identified wrongly. |
